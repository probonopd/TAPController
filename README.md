## Disclaimer

The TAPController library is provided as-is, without any guarantees or warranties. It is intended for educational and experimental purposes and shall be used at your own risk. The library provides control over the Bose Acoustimass module via a serial interface, and improper usage may lead to undesired behavior or potential damage to the hardware. Before using this library, we strongly advise you to read the service manual ("Troubleshooting Guide Powered AcoustimassÂ® -25 and -30 Series II Speaker System AM-25P II/ AM-30P II Digital Bass Module", Part Number 199401-TG1) and fully understand the functionality and limitations of the hardware. The author and contributors of this library are not liable for any damages or issues that may arise from using this library with the Bose Acoustimass module. Always exercise caution and responsibility when interacting with hardware components.

## Installation

To use the TAPController library, you can install it through the Arduino Library Manager or PlatformIO.

### Arduino Library Manager (Arduino IDE)

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Go to `Sketch` -> `Include Library` -> `Manage Libraries`.
3. Search for "TAPController" and click `Install`.

### PlatformIO (VSCode or Atom)

1. Add the following line to the `lib_deps` section in your `platformio.ini` file:
   ```ini
   lib_deps =
       TAPController

## Usage

```cpp
#include <TAPController.h>

TAPController tap(Serial);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(4800); // Start serial communication
}

void loop() {
  // Mute the audio
  tap.muteAudio();
  delay(5000); // Sleep for 5 seconds

  // Unmute the audio
  tap.unmuteAudio();
  delay(5000); // Sleep for 5 seconds
}
```
